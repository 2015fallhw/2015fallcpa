    "John Doe!\".\n",
    "Exercise 1.8: Type casting\n",
    "Very often, one wants to “cast” variables of a certain type into another type. Suppose we have variable\n",
    "x = ’123’, but really we would like x to be an integer.\n",
    "This is easy to do in Python, just use desiredtype(x), e.g. int(x) to obtain an integer.\n",

    "(b) Print the numbers 0 to 100 that are divisible by 7\n",
    "Exercise 2.4: Hangman update 1\n",
    "Let’s reconsider the hangman code we saw in class.1 We noted that the computer agent is not very good\n",
    "at guessing. Update the code such that the computer guesses ‘e’ first, and ’a’ second.\n",
    "Use the simulate.py script to see if this improves performance.\n",
    "Feel free to play around and see if you can do better!\n",
    "Exercise 2.5: While loops\n",
    "Use a while loop to find the first 20 numbers that are divisible by 5, 7 and 11, and print them Hint:\n",
    "store the number found so far in a variable.\n",
    "Pseudo-code:\n",
    "number found = 0\n",
    "x = 11\n",

    "3xi + 1 if xi\n",
    "is odd\n",
    "If xi = 1, we stop iterating and have found the full sequence.\n",
    "For example, if we start with x0 = 5, we obtain the sequence:\n",

    "comprehension, where you are given x and a list with coefficients coefs (hint: use enumerate)\n",
    "Exercise 4.7: Filter\n",
    "In lecture we have seen how to implement map using list comprehensions. Implement filter using list\n",
    "comprehensions. Name your functions myfilter so you can compare with Python’s standard filter.\n",
    "Exercise 4.8: Flatten a list of lists\n",
    "Consider having a list with lists as elements, e.g. [[1,3], [3,6]].\n",
    "Write a function that takes such a list, and returns a list with as elements the elements of the sublists,\n",
    "e.g. [1, 3, 3, 6].\n",
    "Exercise 4.9: Finding the longest word\n",
    "Write a function that returns the longest word in a variable text that contains a sentence. While text\n",

    "Exercise 4.10: Collatz sequence, part 2\n",
    "Recall the Collatz sequence problem from Section 1. Our goal is to find the number n < 1, 000, 000 that\n",

    "(a) Write a function that for any n, returns its Collatz sequence as a list\n",
    "Page 5\n",

    "Write a function that takes a value x and a list ys, and returns a list that contains the value x and all\n",
    "elements of ys such that all values y in ys that are smaller than x come first, then we element x and\n",

    "For example, the output of f(3, [6, 4, 1, 7]) should be [1, 3, 6, 4, 7]\n",
    "Exercise 4.12: Prime challenge\n",
    "Write the function primes(n) that return a list with all prime numbers up to n using three (or less)\n",
    "lines of code.\n",
    "Hint 1: Use lambda functions and list comprehensions.\n",
    "Hint 2: Use the first two lines to define two helper (lambda) functions.\n",
    "5 Tuples\n",
    "Exercise 5.1: Swapping two values\n",
    "Suppose you have two variables: a and b. Now you want to set a equal to the value of b and at the\n",
    "same time set b equal to the value of a.\n",
    "The following obviously does not work\n",
    "a = b\n",
    "b = a\n",
    "so in some languages, you need to define a third variable like this\n",
    "t = a\n",
    "a = b\n",
    "b = t\n",
    "However, in Python you don’t need to do this. How can you swap a and b in one line?\n",
    "Exercise 5.2: Zip\n",
    "Suppose we have two lists, x and y that give the x and y coordinates of a set of points. Create a list\n",
    "with the coordinates (x,y) as a tuple. Hint: Find out about the zip function.\n",
    "You have decided that actually, you need the two seperate lists, but unfortunately, you have thrown\n",
    "them away. How can we use zip to unzip the list of tuples to get two lists again?\n",
    "Exercise 5.3: Distances\n",
    "Suppose we have two vectors, x and y, stored as tuples with n elements. Implement functions that\n",

    "6 Dictionaries\n",
    "Exercise 6.1: Printing a dictionary\n",
    "Write a function that prints key-value pairs of a dictionary.\n",
    "Exercise 6.2: Histogram\n",
    "Write a function that takes a list, and returns a dictionary with keys the elements of the list and as\n",
    "value the number of occurances of that element in the list.\n",
    "After you are done, look up ‘python collections counter’ in Google. Could you use a counter instead?\n",
    "Page 6\n",
    "CME 193 Introduction to Python Exercises\n",
    "Exercise 6.3: Get method\n",
    "Dictionaries have a get method, which takes a key and a default value. If the key is in the dictionary,\n",
    "it returns the value, otherwise, it returns the default value.\n",
    "Rewrite your code from the previous problem to make use of this get method.\n",
    "Exercise 6.4: Random text generator\n",
    "In this question we will start implementing a random text generator. The generated phrases somewhat\n",
    "resemble English, but are usually nonsense. Next week, after we learn about file I/O, we are ready to\n",
    "complete the code.\n",
    "To generate sentences, we first construct a so-called Markov chain based on actual text data. This is a\n",
    "very basic language model. We can then sample paths from this Markov chain to create new phrases.\n",
    "This is actually easier than it sounds:\n",
    "A Markov chain consists of states, and transition probabilities between states: i.e. when I am in state\n",
    "A, what is the probability that I’ll go to state B?\n",
    "We focus on the simple case where the state will be the current word. Consider the example sentence\n",
    "‘the fire and the wind.’ Then, the states that we move through are\n",
    "BEGIN → the → fire → and → the → wind. → END\n",
    "where ‘BEGIN’ and ‘END’ are special states for the beginning and the end of the sentence. To find the\n",
    "transition probabilities, we go over a large body of text and record current word and the next word. In\n",
    "the above example, ‘BEGIN’ is followed by ‘the’, and ‘the’ is followed by ‘fire’ and ‘wind’.\n",
    "We won’t be computing actual probabilities. Instead, we create a dictionary that, for every word,\n",
    "contains all the words that follow it. To generate a phrase, we start at the ‘BEGIN’ state, and pick\n",
    "randomly one word from the list of words that follows the ‘BEGIN’ state. Then we look up which words\n",
    "follow that word, and again pick one word at random, until we hit the ‘END’ state, which signals that\n",
    "we are done.\n",
    "Before you get started, download the starter code by using\n",
    "$ git clone https://github.com/schmit/Markov-chain-startercode.git (if you have git / use\n",
    "Cloud9) or dowload the code directly:\n",
    "https://github.com/schmit/Markov-chain-startercode/archive/master.zip\n",
    "Then\n",
    "• Implement the process line function, which takes a line as input, and returns a list with tuples\n",
    "with the current state, and the next state.\n",
    "• Implement the process textfile function, which loops over text, calls process line to extract\n",
    "the transitions, and adds these to a dictionary. For now, do not worry about reading data from a\n",
    "file, the lines are given as elements of the list f.\n",
    "• Implement the generate line function, which generates random phrases based on a dictionary\n",
    "with transitions.\n",
    "See markov.py for a more detailed description of each function.\n",
    "To run the code, use python markov.py <filename>. Since we are not using any files yet, replace\n",
    "<filename> with a random word.\n",
    "Exercise 6.5: Vector functions\n",
    "Let’s implement some vector functions. There are two types of vectors, normal or dense vectors, which\n",
    "we can represent using lists. For sparse vectors, where many of the elements are zero, this is inefficient.\n",
    "Instead, we use a dictionary with keys the indices of non-zero values, and then the value corresponding\n",
    "to the key is the value of the vector at that index. Hence, the vector [1, 2, 4] can be stored as a list: [1,\n",
    "2, 4] or as a dictionary {0:1, 1: 2, 2: 4}.\n",
    "Page 7\n",
    "CME 193 Introduction to Python Exercises\n",
    "(a) Write a function that adds two (dense) vectors\n",
    "(b) Write a function that multiplies (i.e. inner product) two (dense) vectors\n",
    "(c) Write a function that adds two sparse vectors\n",
    "(d) Write a function that multiplies two sparse vectors\n",
    "(e) Write a function that adds a sparse vector and a dense vector\n",
    "(f) Write a function that multiplies a sparse vector and a dense vector\n",
    "Exercise 6.6: Reverse look-up\n",
    "Dictionaries are made to look up values by keys. Suppose however, we want to find the key that is\n",
    "associated with some value. Write a function that takes a dictionary and a value, and returns the key\n",
    "associated with this value.\n",
    "What challenges do you face? How would you deal with those challenges?\n",
    "7 File I/O\n",
    "Exercise 7.1: Open a file\n",
    "Write a function that opens a file (input: filename), and prints the file line by line.\n",
    "Exercise 7.2: Wordcount\n",
    "On the course website you can find a text file containing the complete works of William Shapespeare.\n",
    "(a) Find the 20 most common words\n",
    "(b) How many unique words are used?\n",
    "(c) How many words are used at least 5 times?\n",
    "(d) Write the 200 most common words, and their counts, to a file.\n",
    "Exercise 7.3: Random text generator II\n",
    "In this exercise, we will finish the implementation of our random text generator from Question 6.4.\n",
    "Change the process textfile function such that it reads a file line by line and processes it, instead of\n",
    "using the hardcoded sample. This should require only a few changes to the code.\n",
    "Generate some random sentences based on the books provided in the data/ folder.\n",
    "As you will notice, most phrases are very random. To make the phrases seem a little more realistic, we\n",
    "should use not just the last word, but the two last words. Going back to our previous example: ‘the fire\n",
    "and the wind.’ we would have the (state, new word) pairs: (‘the fire’, ‘and’), (‘fire and’, ‘the’), (‘and\n",
    "the’, ‘wind’) etc. Update your code to use states consisting of two words instead of one.\n",
    "Bonus: Using more than 2 words is infeasible unless we have massive amounts of text data because the\n",
    "number of states gets increasingly large. Change your code such that you can specify k, the number of\n",
    "words per state.\n",
    "Exercise 7.4: Sum of lists\n",
    "Before you start coding, please read the entire problem.\n",
    "(a) Data generation\n",
    "Write a function that takes three integers, n, a and b and a filename and writes to the file a list\n",
    "with n random integers between a and b.\n",
    "Page 8\n",
    "CME 193 Introduction to Python Exercises\n",
    "(b) Reading the data\n",
    "Write a function that can read the files as generated above and return the values.\n",
    "(c) Sum problem\n",
    "Write a function that given two filenames (pointing to files as generated by the above function) and\n",
    "an integer k, finds all u and v such that u + v = k, and u is an element of the first list and v is a\n",
    "member of the second list.\n",
    "(d) Testing\n",
    "Test your functions by generating 2 files with n = 2000, a = 1, b = 10000 and k = 5000 and\n",
    "k = 12000.\n",
    "(e) Bonus: Efficiency\n",
    "If you are up to a challenge, write a function that solves the sum problem with the restriction that\n",
    "you can only go over every number in the both lists once.\n",
    "8 Classes\n",
    "Exercise 8.1: Rational numbers\n",
    "In this problem, we will write a class that can represent rational numbers, i.e. fractions p\n",

    ".\n",
    "(a) Create a class Rational which is initialized by two integers, p and q, the nominator and denominator\n",
    "(b) Add a method to print the rational number as p/q (the __str__ or __repr__ method is useful).\n",
    "(c) We would like to represent 10\n",
    "20 by 1\n",
    "2\n",
    "instead, hence write a function that computes the greatest\n",

    "be handy).\n",
    "(j) Add any more functionality that you think is useful but I failed to mention.\n",

    "In this problem, we will finish an implementation for Rock-Paper-Scissors. We have written some code\n",
    "to get you started, now it’s up to you to finish the implementation.\n",
    "The code consists of 2 files: game.py and agent.py. The code that implements the actual game is coded\n",
    "in game.py. agent.py defines several agents that can play the game. Download the starter code here\n",
